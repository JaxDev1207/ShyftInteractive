    <p class="text-gray-400 text-lg max-w-2xl">
      At Shyft Interactive, we believe that games and creative experiences should bring people together. These guidelines help keep our community safe, welcoming, and enjoyable for everyone. By using our games or services, you agree to follow these principles.
    </p>
    <p class="text-gray-400 text-lg max-w-2xl">
      💬 Be Kind

Treat others with respect. We welcome players from all backgrounds — bullying, hate speech, harassment, or discrimination of any kind will not be tolerated.

🛡️ Play Fair

Don’t cheat, exploit bugs, or use hacks that give unfair advantages or harm the experience for others.

🎧 Respect Privacy

Do not record, log, or share another player’s voice, personal data, or gameplay without their consent.

⚙️ Use Responsibly

Do not use our games or services to spread harmful, illegal, or disruptive content (including spam, scams, or malicious files).

🧱 Protect Our Worlds

Modding, custom content, or creative play is encouraged — but please do not use our tools or assets in ways that misrepresent or damage the Shyft Interactive brand or community.

🚨 Reporting & Enforcement

If you see harmful behavior or content, please report it through our in-game reporting tools or via our official support channels.
We reserve the right to take appropriate action — including warnings, temporary suspensions, or permanent bans — when these guidelines are violated.

❤️ Our Goal

We’re building experiences where creativity and kindness thrive. Thank you for being part of that vision.
